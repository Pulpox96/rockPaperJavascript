Practising Javascript

Html contains the javascript script.

It has 2 functions:

1) computerPlay: It gives, at random (using Math.Random()), Rock, Paper or Scissors; 

2) playGame: This is the main function. Compares user choice vs the computer choice. It returns "You Win!" "You Lose!" or "Tie!" (normal rock, paper, scissors rules).

Also, it lets the player choose how many times they want to play. Using a for loop, just for simplicity.

In the for loop, it console logs the results and it keeps a record of how many wins the computer and the user have. And at the end it console logs who won the overall match.
